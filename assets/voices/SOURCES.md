RENAX processing (revised 2026-10-05): complete original utterances, mono PCM WAV 48 kHz / 16-bit, only outside-silence trimming with protected consonant pre-roll, gentle low-frequency filtering and linear gain normalization. Internal pauses and word endings are preserved. No pitch shifting, no time stretching and no synthetic speech.

The source speakers and licenses above are unchanged. The previous silence-removal treatment could cut weak consonants or stop at an internal pause. All 80 samples were restored from these same original sources:

Per-word timing landmarks and SHA-256 sample identities are in tests/voice-anchors.json. Replacing or regenerating any sample requires recalibration.
